# Graduate JS exercise

Dear recruiter 

I couldn’t pass the test in the format require due to my lack of industry experience, but I manage to the first task to give the answer in the terminal. But I know that if exposed to industry experience, I’ll be able to learn the ins and out and become a greater asset to the company. I am always willing to learn and develop my skills.
